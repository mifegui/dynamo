"""Tighten the NCCL/collective watchdog timeout once a replica is serving traffic.

During startup, model loading, warmup, CUDA-graph capture, the first cross-node
all-reduce, and load spikes can legitimately take many seconds. The process-group
timeout must therefore remain generous during initialization.

Once the replica is serving steady traffic, individual TP/PP collectives are sub-second,
so a much lower timeout (default 5s) gives fast HANG detection without false positives.
This module lowers the timeout via ``_set_pg_timeout`` once the engine is past warmup.

Pairs with the ZMQ rank-liveness watcher (dynamo.common.rank_liveness): that catches
*crashes* in ~one heartbeat; this catches *hangs* within the serving timeout.

Config:
  DYN_GMS_SERVING_NCCL_TIMEOUT_S        serving timeout in seconds (default 5; <=0 disables)

NOTE on failover latency: the serving timeout governs DETECTION. How fast the process then
*dies* (releasing the failover flock) is governed by TORCH_NCCL_WAIT_TIMEOUT_DUMP_MILSEC —
the monitoring thread waits that long for the flight-recorder dump to coordinate before
aborting. Default 60000ms; measured ~69s exit at the default vs ~5.5s with it set to 1000.
Set TORCH_NCCL_WAIT_TIMEOUT_DUMP_MILSEC=1000 (and TORCH_NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING=1) for
prompt failover. This module warns once if it is left high.
